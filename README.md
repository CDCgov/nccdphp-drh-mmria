Maternal Mortality Review Data System

The Maternal Mortality Review and Data System (MMRDS) is a software tool created by CDC to collect, store, analyze and summarize information relevant to maternal deaths. The MMRDS serves 2 purposes: first to provide complete, detailed, and organized medical and social information that can be used by medical review committees to investigate individual maternal deaths; and second to provide a standardized cumulative database for future research and analysis on maternal mortality.
