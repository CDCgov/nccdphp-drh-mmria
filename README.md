# MMRIA

## Maternal Mortality Review Information Application

The Maternal Mortality Review Information Application, or  **MMRIA**, is a software tool created, developed, and maintained by CDC to collect, store, analyze, surveillance and summarize information relevant to maternal deaths. The MMRIA system as it is now is a newer, more improved version of the older system known as Maternal Mortality Review and Data System (MMRDS).

The MMRIA system serves 2 purposes:

  1. First, to provide complete, detailed, and organized medical and social information that can be used by medical review committees to investigate individual maternal deaths.
  2. Second to provide a standardized cumulative database for future research and analysis on maternal mortality.
