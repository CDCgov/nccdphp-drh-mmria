	<h1 style="font:Work Sans Medium">Welcome to MMRIA.org</h1>
	
	<h2 style="font:Work Sans Light">MMRIA.org | your destination for news and information related to the Maternal Mortality Review Information APP.</h2>
	
	<p style="font:Work Sans Extra Light">The Maternal Mortality Review Information APP (MMRIA) was originally developed based on decades of work by the CDC Division of Reproductive Health.  The MMRIA standardizes information collected by maternal death reviews and defines a core set of information that all users collect; all in a free software package with strong user support and which is easily adapted by reviews. The MMRIA has four primary purposes:</p>

	<ul style="font:Work Sans Extra Light">
		<li>Serve as a data abstraction tool</li>
		<li>Support case summary development</li>
		<li>Document committee findings and recommendations</li>
		<li>Support analysis (internaly and through exported data)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p style="font:Work Sans Extra Light">In addition to supporting individual reviews, the MMRIA can also bring together data at the regional and national level; supporting the development of summaries across geographic boundaries, identification and analysis of rare and emerging causes of death, and common recommendations for action.</p>
