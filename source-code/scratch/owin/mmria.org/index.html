<meta name="description" content="The Maternal Mortality Review Information App (MMRIA) is a public health software tool created to collect, store, analyze and summarize information relevant to maternal deaths. The MMRIA serves 2 purposes: first to provide complete, detailed, and organized medical and social information that can be used by medical review committees to investigate individual maternal deaths; and second to provide a standardized cumulative database for future research and analysis on maternal mortality.">

<h2 style="font:Work Sans Light"><strong>WHAT</strong> is the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application?</h2>

<p style="font:Work Sans Light">MMRIA (or "Maria") is a data system designed to empower the maternal mortality review community to create action through a common data language.</p>


<p style="font:Work Sans Light">MMRIA is designed to support standardized:</p>
<ul style="font:Work Sans Extra Light">
<li>Case abstraction,</li>
<li>Case narrative development,</li>
<li>Documentation of committee deliberations on pregnancy relatedness, preventability, and contributing factors, and</li>
<li>Routine analyses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font:Work Sans Light">WHY do you need MMRIA?</h2>
<p style="font:Work Sans Light">Standardized data collection is a first step toward fully understanding the causes of maternal mortality and eliminating preventable maternal deaths. MMRIA helps Maternal Mortality Review Committees organize available data and begin the critical steps necessary to comprehensively identify and assess cases.</p>

<p style="font:Work Sans Light">MMRIA provides:</p>
<ul style="font:Work Sans Extra Light">
<li>a repository for the collection of medical and social information surrounding an individual maternal death that can be used to facilitate review by a state- or jurisdiction-based maternal mortality review committee; and</li>
<li>a cumulative record of selected standardized indicators common to most maternal deaths that can be used for surveillance, monitoring, and research of maternal mortality.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font:Work Sans Light">MMRIA is available at no cost and technical support is provided.</p>
