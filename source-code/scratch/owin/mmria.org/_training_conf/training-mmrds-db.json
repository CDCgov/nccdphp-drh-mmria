She also had one to two episodes of emesis and two to three episodes of diarrhea. She denied any blood or mucus in stool or emesis. The patient was admitted to the hospital in 2005 and diagnosed with post-partum cardiomyopathy. She did not follow up with her cardiologist and was treated with Lasix. She has had two pregnancies since 2005 and her last pregnancy was normal delivery on 3/7/09. The patient denies headache, light headedness, abdominal pain, or any change in bowel habits. \nSocial history - patient smokes 3-4 cigarettes a day. \nFamily medical history - brother passed away from heart failure at 19 years of age.\nPE - lungs clear, positive systolic murmur, regular rate and rhythm, 3+ edema, \nLabs listed below\nImpression: CHF exacerbation - 2 episodes of non-sustained VT. \nPlan:  \n1.\t Start on low dose Coreg. \n2.\tFluid restriction. Strict I/O’s, cardiac enzymes. \n3.\tStart ACE if blood pressure does not improve. \n4.\tWill review old records. \n5.\tElevated liver enzymes - congestive hepatomegaly, Will expect improvement when CHF has been stabilized, \n6.\tleukocytosis secondary to stress - will check UA. \n7.\tDVT and peptic ulcer prophylaxis\n\n4/19/09 Echo - EF - 20-30%, severe mitral regurgitation, annulus is dilated, severe tricuspid regurgitation, dilated & hypokinetic right ventricle\n\nCardiology (consult on 4/19/09) states Impression: severe post-partum cardiomyopathy, CHF, severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, EF 20-30%, dilated hypokinetic right ventricle, non-compliance with follow up. Admit to ICU,  administer diuresis, considering reinstituting low dose ace inhibitor at this time - Lisinopril 2.5 mg once blood pressure is more stabilized will consider adding beta blocker. Will consider transfer to a tertiary care center.\nDischarge Planning: Pt transferred to a higher level of

Post-partum cardiomyopathy. G5P4A1. Hx asthma who presented to another hospital system with progressive complaints of SOB X 1 month. Pt is primarily French speaking and per pts sister who translates for the pt., the pt. delivered a baby on 3/7/09 and since the delivery has been experiencing SOB and LE edema.  She had runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  \nUpon evaluating at the other hospital, Transthoracic echocardiogramrevealed: Left Ventricle with normal wall thickness and anejection fraction of 20-30%. The right ventricle is  Dilated and hypokinetic.  There is  biatrial enlargement with 4+ Mitral Regurgitation and  4+ Tricuspid Regurgitation.\nPE protocol CT done at the outside hospitalwas negative\nLabs:   BNP 4943, CPK 366, CKMB 55, Troponin 0.63.\nPer information from the outside hospital, pt. has been non-compliant with medical care in the past and was aware of her cardiomyopathy when she was pregnant in 2006 for which she chose to electively abort for health reasons.  Transthoracic echocardiogram (2006) Ejection Fraction 20%, dilated Right Ventricle with  decreased function, mild Left Atrial Enlargement and Right Atrial Enlargement, mod Tricuspid Regurgitation.  \nInformation obtained from patient with assistance of sister tells that patient has been progressively SOB for the past month. On 3/31/09 she got diagnosed with “pleurisy” and discharged home. She felt better after she went to the ER for the next 3 days. In the f/u, was started on Lasix and kcl but today at 530 am she started having CP radiating to the rt arm associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. She then presented to the ED at an outside hospital where she was diagnosed with NSTEMI and cardiogenic shock.  She was transferred to a tertiary care center for further management\nPMH: cardiomyopathy developed after 5th pregnancy. No surgical history. No family history. Smokes 1 ppd for 11 years, but quit (can we state when, i.e. prior to delivery or immediately pp?)\nMedication: Prior to admission: Lasix 20 mg daily, Albuterol, KCL 20 oral daily, Nitroglycerin IV continuous, Heparin IV as needed, Aspirin 325 mg oral daily, Furosemide 40 mg injection IV once.\nAllergies: Tramadol and Ibuprofen\nPE - Heart Rate 124 bpm, Blood Pressure 106/76, 97% on 4 L Nasa; Cannula, general mild distress at this time; lying flat; Heart: regular rate and rhythm.  , normal S1, nl S2, Systolic Ejection Murmur 3+/6+ best heard in aortic area, Lungs: Clear ToAuscultation bilaterally  after doses of Lasix, diminished Breath Sounds on bases bilaterally.

Black Haitian female with history of post-partum cardiomyopathy, asthma, presented today with NSTEMI (non ST elevation myocardial infarction) probably due to embolic origin. Transferred to tertiary care center due to new onset cardiogenic shock state.\nPregnancy Status: 1.5 months post-partum\nTests:\n4/20/09:  Summary of Cardiology: The assessment is that of cardiogenic shock refractory to medical treatment. \nTreatment options are limited. Any option that would require femoral artery access is limited, as the patient has very small common femoral arteries and there are concerns about her distal pulses.   Inotropic medications are risky due to the presence of ventricular tachycardia and ischemia/infarction from embolism. Transesophageal echocardiogram shows a right ventricular dysfunction she may need right ventricular support in addition to left ventricular support.\nDuring her left Cardiac catheterization the patient  went into a wide complex tachycardia at 200 bpm after the sheath was pulled, the patient. She spontaneously converted out of this rhythm.  The catheterization demonstrated (pertinent positives): Atrio-Ventricular continuation occluded. The left circumflex artery gives off two obtuse marginal branches both of which have distal thrombi that appears to be from embolism. She went had a Swan Ganz catheter placed.\nMain barrier to Left Ventricular Assist Device placement/transplant candidacy appears to be psychosocial situation and the question of her compliance. There does appear to be some extenuating circumstances (isolated in an abusive relationship, but this needs to be further delineated).\n4/21/09 Right groin ultrasound- negative for pseudo-aneurysm, DVT, arteriovenous fistula, and hematoma\n4/22/09 Intra-Aortic balloon pump placement\n4/22/09 Carotid duplex - limited right sided study. Abnormal waveforms due to heart pump machine. Left side had stenosis of 0-19%\nCT abdomen and pelvis - completed for due to acute drop in hemoglobin and concerns for intra-abdominal bleeding.  No blood in pelvis or lungs found. Lungs did show multifocal pneumonia. \n4/26/09 - The patient required emergent intubation due to respiratory failure.  This was the date of death.

She was a gravida 6 para 0414, who died with cause of death cardiogenic shock secondary to peripartum cardiomyopathy due to non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), six weeks after delivery. Medical history was significant for heart failure and development of asthma after delivery in 2005. Body mass index (BMI) was 33.8. Life course issues significant for chronic smoker, single mom, living with her sister, Creole-speaking on Medicaid, with restraining order against father of baby (FOB). \n\nEntry into prenatal care was at 36 weeks with four visits at a hospital clinic with an obstetrician (OB). Prenatal history was significant for late entry into care and anemia. There were no referrals made during the prenatal period. \n\nThere were no noted health events prior to delivery. She presented to hospital at 38.3 weeks gestation for induction/augmentation of labor. On admission, she requested sister adopt infant and a social service consult was made. Delivery was by an OB, method was spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) with epidural anesthesia. No obstetric complications noted. Infant was 38 weeks’ gestation and weighed 7 pounds/2 ounces, Apgar scores were 9/9. Day after delivery, she developed dry cough, chest x-ray (CXR) was negative. Social service consult completed for adoption request but due to potential for lengthy paternity legal issues, adoption plans were to be formalized after discharge. Mother and infant were discharged to home. Decedent had scheduled early postpartum visit at 2 weeks. At visit, she complained of (c/o) being tired and still having pain. Edema noted in lower extremities, and she was encouraged to ambulate more and quit smoking. Two days later, she presented to emergency room (ER) (same as delivery facility) with complaints of right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. Studies negative for pulmonary embolus. CXR noted cardiomegaly consistent with postpartum state. Pain relieved with narcotics, and she was discharged home with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician (PCP). Three weeks later, she presented to a different emergency department (ED) with c/o shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain. She was diagnosed with NSTEMI and cardiogenic shock and admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Seven hours after admission, she was transferred out to higher level cardiac care. Cardiac catheterization was completed. Cardiac support given but patient died seven days after admission. The case was not referred to the medical examiner (ME) and no autopsy was performed.\n\nPRENATAL CARE\nDecedent was a gravida 6 para 0414 with a past obstetric history of premature rupture of membrane (PROM) x 4 and induced abortion (AB) for medical condition. No prior surgeries noted. Her family medical history was positive for brother passing away from cardiac disease at age 19. Pre-existing medical conditions included development of asthma and heart failure after delivery in 2005. She was 5’4” and weighed 193 pounds. Her BMI was 33.8. \nIn the sentinel pregnancy, she entered care at 36 weeks’ gestation and weighed 193 pounds. She attended four visits at a hospital clinic with an OB and had Medicaid insurance. Screening was performed for substance use and was negative. Screening was performed for domestic violence and was positive (decedent had restraining order against FOB). Additional social determinant factors identified include Creole-speaking (using sister as her interpreter), single mother, and chronic smoker.\nThe pregnancy was complicated by late entry into care and anemia. There were no referrals during the prenatal period. Diagnostic procedures during pregnancy included ultrasound at first visit for dates. Abnormal labs during pregnancy include hemoglobin (Hgb) 10.1 and hematocrit (HCT) 31. No abnormal vital signs noted during pregnancy. During the sentinel pregnancy, she was on prenatal vitamins. At routine visit at 38 weeks, she was noted to be dilated and sent to labor and delivery (L&D) for induction of labor.\nLABOR AND DELIVERY:\nOn admission, mother requested that infant be adopted to her sister. Admission screening noted smoker, positive domestic violence with restraining order against FOB, low hemorrhagic risk, low risk deep venous thromboses (DVTs). She had Pitocin induction for advanced dilatation with early labor delivering four hours after admission. She delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery by an OB under epidural at a Level 1 hospital. Medications administered during labor and delivery or postpartum included Pitocin for labor augmentation. Infant weighed 7 lbs., 2 ounces with Apgars of 9/9.\nLate decelerations were noted and desaturation of mother during labor resolving with face mask FIO2. Postpartum period significant for dry cough postpartum. Due to remote history heart failure/asthma, CXR ordered and was negative per radiologist. Social service consult completed with translator line re: adoption request. Process to be completed after discharge as adoption dependent on FOB legal release of paternity. Community resource information given. She was discharged home on day two. Vitals signs at discharge included T 36.5, heart rate (HR) 90, respiratory rate (RR) 18, and blood pressure (BP) 113/79. She was instructed to follow up (f/up) with OB in two weeks. Discharge education included warning signs postpartum: fever, extreme sadness, breast care. \nPOSTPARTUM CARE\nShe presented for scheduled postpartum visit two weeks after delivery. Weight was 195 pounds. BP 110/80, pulse 98, RR 18. Edema noted in extremities. Per sister as interpreter, mother c/o being very tired and still c/o pain. Told to continue Motrin and call if pain does not go away. States still smoking. Encouraged to quit and ambulate more. Family planning discussed. \n\n\nED Visit #1\nTwo days after postpartum visit with OB she presented to Level 1 facility (same as delivery facility) with right-sided chest pain radiating down right arm and shortness of breath for two hours. Her weight was 195 pounds, temperature 96.7, BP 121/76, HR 109, resp 16, and oxygen saturation (sat) 96% on room air. Medical history noted as negative except for history smoker x 15 years. Social history significant for Creole-speaking with sister acting as translator. She had +1 edema in extremities and noted on admission as appearing “distressed.” Computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for pulmonary embolus. Her pain 10/10 increased with deep breaths. She was given Vicodin po and then Morphine IV after she vomited. CXR significant for cardiomegaly which radiologist considered “normal for her postpartum state.” Steroids and Albuterol treatment given for her respiratory distress. (Abstractor note: No documentation found that her OB was consulted regarding her presentation). Her sister cared for her newborn in ED while all procedures were done. Three hours after arrival, mother requested to go home as she felt better. Vital signs (VS) at discharge were temp 97.8, HR 90, RR 16, sat 98% on room air. She was considered stable for discharge and instructed to follow up with her PCP for any issues.\nED/HOSPITALIZATION #2\nSix weeks postpartum, she presented via family car to the ED at a Level 3 trauma center. She was noted as self-pay. Her chief complaint was SOB, cough, congestion, and chest pain (10/10). Decedent stated having symptoms x three weeks and was seen in another ED last week for same symptoms that have not improved. Chief complaints include taking Motrin for pain with little relief, can’t lie down to sleep, and coughing all night. C/o chest pressure with nausea and vomiting. \nHer weight on admission was 199 and her presenting vital signs were: BP 84/64, temp 98, pulse 94, RR 26, O2 sat 98% on non re-breather mask (NRBM). In nurses’ admission notation, social history deferred screening due to language barrier (Creole-speaking) and patient medical condition.\n \nPhysical examination on admission found: CARDIOVASCULAR: systolic murmur, (regular rate and rhythm (RRR), RESPIRATORY: few crackles at bilateral lung bases, no retractions, +3 edema lower extremities bilaterally. \n\nLabs performed included complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes and urine drug screen with some abnormal findings noted including cardiac enzymes. Diagnostic tests performed included with the following abnormal findings noted: electrocardiogram (EKG): NSTEMI, CXR: cardiomegaly, bases with fluid (difficult to read due to body habitus), CT chest negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), echocardiogram (ECHO): ejection fraction (EF) 20-30% severe mitral regurgitation, annulus is dilated, severe tricuspid regurgitation, dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Her diagnosis was severe postpartum cardiomyopathy/congestive heart failure (CHF) and 2 ½ hours later she was admitted to ICU for stabilization and consideration for transfer to tertiary care center for possible cardiac cath/heart transplant work up. Intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia were noted. She was started on cardiac medications and given diuretics. Due to increased distress, she was transported to higher level care seven hours later. VS at transfer were: temp 97.1-98-24, BP 100/72, saturation 93% on 10 liters nasal cannula.\n\nED/HOSPITALIZATION #3 – TERMINAL EVENT\nSeven hours after admission to ICU, decedent was ground-transported to higher level of care at a regional trauma center for cardiac catheterization and transplant evaluation. Cardiac catheterization was done and treatment options were considered limited due to her small common femoral arteries compromising her distal circulation, history of ventricular tachycardia, and concerns for her overall long-term ability for compliance with medical therapy. After intra-aortic balloon pump placement, she experienced drop in hemoglobin. CT abdominal scan negative for bleeding in pelvis or lungs. She developed pneumonia and started on antibiotics. Her sister was unable to stay with her due to childcare issues. Seven days after admission she had a respiratory arrest requiring intubation and was pronounced same day. (Abstractor Note: No records available regarding sequence of events leading up to demise or family contact after her death) The case was not reported to the medical examiner/coroner. Autopsy was not performed.\n"},"committee_review":{"date_of_review":"2016-09-10","pregnancy_relatedness":"Pregnancy-Related","estimate_degree_relevant_information_available":"Somewhat Complete","does_committee_agree_with_cod_on_death_certificate":"No","notes_about_key_circumstances_surrounding_death":"","committee_determination_of_causes_of_death":[{"type":"Underlying","cause_descriptive":"Peripartum cardiomyopathy","comments":""}],"pmss_mm":"80.1 Post-Partum/Peripartum Cardiomyopathy","pmss_mm_secondary":"","did_obesity_contribute_to_the_death":"Probably","did_mental_health_conditions_contribute_to_the_death":"No","did_substance_use_disorder_contribute_to_the_death":"No","was_this_death_a_sucide":"No","was_this_death_a_homicide":"No","means_of_fatal_injury":"Not Applicable","specify_other_means_fatal_injury":"","if_homicide_relationship_of_perpetrator":"Not Applicable","specify_other_relationship":"","was_this_death_preventable":"Yes","chance_to_alter_outcome":"Some Chance","critical_factors_worksheet":[{"category":"Patient/Family","class":"Adherence","description":"adherence to cardiac manageament"},{"category":"Patient/Family","class":"Delay","description":"late entry into prenatal care"},{"category":"Patient/Family","class":"Violence","description":"intimate partner violence"},{"category":"Provider","class":"Continuity of Care/Care Coordination","description":"lack of care coordination"},{"category":"Provider","class":"Communication","description":""},{"category":"Provider","class":"Clinical Skill/Quality of Care","description":"missed diagnosis signs of CHF at postpartum ER visit"},{"category":"Facility","class":"Policies/Procedures","description":"translation and interpretation services"},{"category":"Facility","class":"Continuity of Care/Care Coordination","description":"lack of continuity of care within the same hospital at different visits (known chronic health history on previous records, OB not notified of postpartum ER visit)"},{"category":"Facility","class":"Communication","description":"patient did not seem to have received postpartum discharge instructions that she understood"}],"recommendations_of_committee":[{"committee_recommendations":"Referral to cardiologist during prenatal care or between pregnancies for women with reported cardiac conditions.","prevention":"Primary","impact_level":"Medium"},{"committee_recommendations":"Facilities should require use of and provide access to official translation services.

Another needle track mark was found on her left wrist which also appeared to be a couple of days old. \n\nPD interviewed nurses. Nurses informed PD that patient was in ED for CT scan of chest to rule out pulmonary embolism. PD was informed patient was given 2 Percocet in ER while awaiting for CT scan for complaints of pain. Patient then asked to use the restroom.  The patient’s nurse heard labored breathing coming from the bathroom and went into the restroom and saw patient slumped over the toilet and unable to respond.

She was a gravida 2 para 1001, who died with a cause of death of acute intoxication by heroin with underlying intravenous (IV) drug use three days after delivery. Her body mass index (BMI) was 31.7. \n\nHealth events prior to delivery included a medical history significant for anxiety, tobacco use, and opioid use for back injury. Life course issues significant for single mother, unemployed, substance use, and anxiety. Her first child was diagnosed with autism and lives with a grandmother.\n\nEntry into prenatal care was at 20.5 weeks with two visits at a hospital clinic with an obstetrician (OB). Prenatal history was significant for late-entry, chronic back pain, prior cesarean section (C-section), tobacco, and opioid use. There were no referrals during the prenatal period. \n\nShe presented to hospital at 37 weeks’ gestation. Drug screen on admission was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), opiates, and cocaine. She denied trial of labor and had repeat C-section by an OB via spinal anesthesia. There was thick meconium noted at delivery but no other obstetric complications. Infant was 37 weeks’ gestation and weighed 6 pounds 2 ounces, Apgar scores were 8/8. Postpartum period (before discharge) significant for continued maternal request for pain medication due to neck/back pain and requesting dilaudid for pain control. Social work consult on day one of delivery with mother admitting to substance use but did not want significant other to know this. Later that day, the mother developed respiratory distress with oxygen saturation (O2 sat) decreasing to 65% and wheezing. Respiratory therapy provided albuterol treatments and OB ordered Chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out (R/O) pulmonary embolus.\n\nWhile in CT, mother asked to use the restroom. Shortly after, the nurse found her in the bathroom slumped over, unresponsive, and holding a syringe. Nurse called rapid response and code initiated but resuscitation was unsuccessful. She was pronounced 45 minutes after initiating the code. \n\nAn autopsy was conducted by a medical examiner. Significant findings included acute heroin toxicity. There was no documentation of bereavement support offered.\n\nPRENATAL CARE \nDecedent was a gravida 2 para 1001 with a past obstetric history of cesarean delivery for failure to progress. Her family medical history was positive for breast cancer. Preexisting medical conditions included back/neck injury due to motor vehicle accident. She was 5’1” and weighed 168 pounds. \nIn the sentinel pregnancy, she entered care at 20 weeks’ gestation and weighed 160 pounds. She attended two visits at a hospital clinic setting with an OB and had Medicaid. Screening was performed for substance use and noted smokes 1 ppd and + opioids. Screening was performed for domestic violence and was found to be negative but past history of domestic violence from former partner. Additional social determinants of health factors identified include poverty, single mother with anxiety.\nThe pregnancy was complicated by late entry into care and chronic pain. There were no referrals during the prenatal period. Diagnostic procedures during pregnancy included ultrasound at 20 weeks’ gestation. Abnormal labs during pregnancy include positive drug screen for opioids. During the sentinel pregnancy, she was on prenatal vitamins and Tylenol with codeine. She was noted to be allergic to Toradol, Tramadol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nER/HOSPITAL VISIT  - L & D \nShe presented at 37 weeks’ gestation to the emergency department in a Level II trauma center via private vehicle at 04:00. Her chief complaint was contractions every two minutes. Her weight on admission was 170 pounds and her presenting vital signs were 98.2 temperature, heart rate: 96, respiratory rate: 12, blood pressure: 138/82, O2 sat 99%. Physical examination on admission found 2-3 cm dilated and 80% effaced, -1 station. Labs performed included a complete blood count (CBC), urine analysis, urine drug screen, GBS, electrolytes, PT/ PTT with a positive drug screen noted. Diagnostic tests performed included ultrasound demonstrating 37 weeks’ gestation, vertex, amniotic fluid index within normal limits, fetal heart rate 170. \nShe was delivered by repeat C-section by an OB under spinal anesthesia. Medications administered during labor and delivery or postpartum included Colace, Mylicon, Dilaudid, and Morphine. Infant weighed 6 pounds 2 ounces, Apgar scores were 8/8. Infant developed low O2 saturation, was taken to NICU for observation. Complications during labor, delivery, or postpartum (prior to discharge) include maternal complaints of failure to control pain. \nTERMINAL EVENT \nOn the day after delivery,at 22:55 her O2 sat dropped to 65%. O2 at 10L administered and RT called for albuterol treatment. OB ordered Chest X-Ray and CT scan to R/O pulmonary embolus.\n\nWhile in CT, mother asked to use the restroom. Shortly after, the nurse found her in the bathroom slumped over, unresponsive and holding a syringe. Nurse called rapid response and code initiated but resuscitation was unsuccessful. She was pronounced 45 minutes after initiating the code. Autopsy was done by a medical examiner. Significant findings included acute heroin toxicity. There was no documentation of bereavement support offered. She expired at 02:15 in the hospital. \n\nAUTOPSY\nThe case was reported to the medical examiner. Autopsy was performed. Core findings from the autopsy include the following: \nSystems Exam (Gross Findings): \no\tNo tracks or lines noted on extremities\no\tLungs: right and left lung weigh 800 grams and 740 grams\no\tLungs appear poorly expanded\no\tETT positioned in the right mainstem\nBrain: dura matter and leptomeninges normal \nToxicology Results: \n•\tCannaboids 2ng/ml\n•\tOxycodone 91 mcg/L\n•\tMorphine (free) 1.9 mg/L\n•\tCocaine metabolite (QNS)\nAdditional note: syringe in mother’s hand tested positive for heroin. \nCause of Death (per autopsy):\n1.\tAcute and chronic IV drug use:\na)\tIV heparin lock left hand.\nb)\tOld pin point scars noted left foot between\n2.\tAcute intoxication by oxycodone\n3.\tPulmonary intravascular and perivascular foreign bodies\na)\tAcute pulmonary edema\nb)\tBilateral pleural effusions\nc)\tLeft lung hypoperfusion, collapse\nd)\tLung tissue red brown dark parenchyma\n2.\tPrimary low transverse c/section (5/23/11)\na)\tStapled wound of lower incision\nb)\tSutured incised lower uterine segment\nc)\tHemoperitoneum 200 ml\n3.\tRib fractures: noted 4th, 5th on left side chest.
