Inspection of the body was performed in the county morgue on 09/28/2011.  This inspection was performed by the coroner and the investigator.

Investigative Information: 
Police department responded to a “check the welfare” call.  They found the residence in disarray and the decedent’s two month old daughter and 26 month old daughter unsupervised.  EMS was called and the children were taken to the local Children’s hospital.  Physicians there estimated a length of time of 48-72 hours that the infant could have survived unattended.  The decedent was found in the basement in a seated position with a ligature remnant around the neck.  The scene suggested that the decedent tied the belt to the floor joist with the opposite end around her neck and then leaned forward suspending herself.  Eventually, the tensile strength of the belt was overwhelmed by the decedent’s weight dropping her into the discovery position.  An empty bottle of sertraline was found in the residence. Per the decedent’s father she had had a suicide attempt about 10 years ago and suffered from depression.  External examination of the body was consistent with that of the scene."

Summarization of Events Prior to Demise:  Patient was initially admitted to L&D at 32 weeks gestation due to elevated blood pressure and proteinuria. Diagnosed with mild preeclampsia and started on antenatal steroids. Initial HELLP labs were normal. However, she began to develop worsening blood pressure and increasing epigastric pain- and was then diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. Ultrasound showed fetus in breech position and oligo-hydramnios present. Therefore, decision was made to proceed with C-section. In recovery room, patient began to complain of right sided weakness and was slurring her speech. A CT scan showed a large left intracranial hemorrhage with dissection into the ventricle. She was then transferred to ICU and intubated due to a concern about being able to protect her airways. She remained intubated and sedated over the next few days. She developed some movement of the extremities. She went into acute renal failure and underwent dialysis. After returning from dialysis, nursing staff noticed a change in her vital signs and her pupils were fixed and dilated.  A CT scan of the head showed the brain stem had herniated. After speaking with the neurosurgeons, the patient’s husband decided to withdraw life support. The patient was ex-tubated and quickly went into respiratory arrest, followed by cardiac arrest. 

Medications after delivery included Proventil, Peridex, Decadron, Senokot, Feosol, Prenatal Vitamins, Ocular lubricant, artificial teas, Priolsec, Meruvax, as well as PRN medications, IV fluids, Diprivan drip and Mannitol.

External genitalia reveals marked swelling of the labia, with purple discoloration.  Clotted blood is observed at the introitus of the vagina.  A 2” x 1 ½” triangular laceration is in the opening of the vagina inferiorly.  The soft tissue around this region is hemorrhagic.  Gauze packing is in the vagina.  Uterus and right ovary are missing.  

Approximately 1000ml of clotted and unclotted blood is in the right hemithoax and approximately 1500ml of similar blood is in the left hemithorax.  The peritoneal cavity contains approximately 500ml of watery serosanguineous fluid.  Fracture of the sternum at the level of the second intercostal space.  No blood surrounds this.  The subcutaneous tissues diffusely are markedly edematous.  

Examination of the small bowel and large bowel reveals focal mucosal hemorrhage, without discrete lesions.  The mesentery is markedly edematous.  

Renal arteries are patent.  Examination of the collecting system and hilum reveals marked hemorrhage in the hilum of the right kidney, extending along the ureter.  The ureter itself is unremarkable.  The corticomedullary junctions are distinct.  The ureters are not dilated, and no urine is in the bladder.  The bladder mucosa is focally hemorrhagic.  

The scalp is markedly edematous.  A single small patch of subgaleal blood is in the posterior midline, in the occipital region.  Inspection of the skull and calvarium after stripping the dura reveals no fractures.  The 1260g brain is symmetrical, with no edema or atrophy.  The vessels at the base of the brain are undremarkable.  A film of loose subdural blood overlies the parieto-occipital regious bilaterally.  No subarachnoid blood is noted.  Sectioning through the brain reveals no brain abnormalities.  Specifically no trauma is observed.  No white matter petechiae are noted.  The high cervical spinal cord is grossly unremarkable.  

Micro:
Heart- tiny focal areas of hemorrhage seen.
Brain- mild edema noted. Subarachnoid space is focally hemorrhagic.
Lung- Tissue is congested with large areas of extravasation of red cells.  Fibrin thrombi are seen.  No amniotic fluid emboli are noted.  Macrophages anedema fluid are in the alveolar septae.  
Kidney- fibrin thrombi are seen in the flomeruli.  Chronic inflammatory cells are in the subcapsular area.


Path report of uterus:
Uterine cervix- cervical tissues not identified
Endomyometrial junction- decidual change consistent with status post vahinal delivery.  Focal attachment of chorionic villi to underlying myometrium, consistent with placenta accreta.

Pt was admitted on to undergo a myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from her HLA-identical brother.  Though she is a Jehovah’s Witness she agreed to receive blood product transfusions as necessary.  The MD’s have agreed to transfuse platelets only when her platelet count decreases below 10,000 or if she develops bleeding. Also will transfuse packed red blood cells if she becomes symptomatic or if herhemoglobin decreases below 6.0.
She was D/Cd at 30 days post BMT.  Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of disease and hgb and plt were self sustaining.  She experienced nausea and vomiting and and EGD was performed and showed reflux esophagitis and gastric mucosa erythema.  She was started on scopolamine patch and zofran as well as nexium 40 mg twice daily.  She remained compliant with her care.  
She experienced an insufficiency fracture of the medial tibial condyle of the left lower extremety and was admitted for IV narcotics for pain control.  She did not need surgery for this.  She went home on methadone for further pain control.  No sign of graft-versus-host.  
She was admitted for nephrolithiasis in the left kidney 59 days post BMT.  She received empiric vancomycin and cipro.  She has no evidence of progressive disease nor any evidence of graft-versus-host-disease.  She will follow up as scheduled in the clinic.
Returned for clinic follow-up visit at status post 119 days BMT.  She has evidence of recurring disease based on evidence of increasing blasts and 11:19 translocation returning on cytogenetic analysis.  It was decided to taper her off immunosuppression therapy in hopes of inducing a graft-versus leukemia effect.  If this does not occur, supportive care would be considered rather than more chemotherapy.  
The bone marrow showed 20% overall cellularity with persistent AML demonstrating 35% blasts.  She has decided to pursue comfort care and spend as much time with her husband and boys as possible.  She has d/cd all medication and requires nothing for pain.  She feels her current quality of life is excellent, and she is enjoying her time at home.  She no longer wishes to have any follow-up visits and would like to enter hospice when she feels she is at a point when she needs their support.  Her husband is with her an very supportive of her decision.  She asked very good questions regarding potential symptoms/scenarios as her disease progresses.  MDs are supportive of this decision.  She is to call the clinic if she has any further needs or for follow-up support.  
No hospice records are available.  Date entered into hospice is unknown."
