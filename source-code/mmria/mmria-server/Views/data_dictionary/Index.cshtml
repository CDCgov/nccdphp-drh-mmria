    <h1 class="h2">CSV Data Dictionary</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">This webpage lists, describes, and defines the properties of all fields contained within the MMRIA application database. The metadata webpage is useful for determining field characteristics such as field types and field values. Note that the metadata “name” fields do not correspond to the column names created when you conduct a data export. The data dictionary, including the column names of your exported data, can be found in the exported data file titled “data_dictionary”. This file was previously named “field_mapping”.</p>


		<!--p>The MMRIA export function produces a zip file that contains one or more case data files plus a data dictionary. The zip file is downloaded directly to the “Downloads” folder in the local environment of the user’s computer.</p>
		
		<h3>MMRIA Export Case Files</h3>
		
		
		<p>These files contain MMRIA case data. Abbreviated MMRIA field names are displayed as column names. These abbreviated column names meet the naming requirements of commonly used statistical applications (e.g., SAS).</p>
		
		 
		
		<h3>MMRIA Export Data Dictionary</h3>
		
		<p>A data dictionary file is created when MMRIA case data are exported. The column names included in the data dictionary correspond to variable names when the data are imported into a standard statistical application. This file can be used to map the column names in the exported data files to the file and full path from where it came in the MMRIA database. For example, the column name “bfdcpr_ro_mothe” refers to the race field on the parent section of the Birth/Fetal Death Certificate form within MMRIA. Note that each data-dictionary file is specific to the MMRIA case data that it is exported with.</p-->
