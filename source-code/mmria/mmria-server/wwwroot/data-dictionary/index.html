<meta name="description" content="The Maternal Mortality Review Information App (MMRIA) is a public health software tool created to collect, store, analyze and summarize information relevant to maternal deaths. The MMRIA serves 2 purposes: first to provide complete, detailed, and organized medical and social information that can be used by medical review committees to investigate individual maternal deaths; and second to provide a standardized cumulative database for future research and analysis on maternal mortality.">

		<h10>MMRIA CSV Export Format</h10>
		<p>The MMRIA export function produces a zip file that contains one or more case data files plus a data dictionary. The zip file is downloaded directly to the “Downloads” folder in the local environment of the user’s computer.</p> 
		
		<p><b>MMRIA Export Case File(s)</b> One or more files that contain MMRIA case data. Abbreviated MMRIA field names are created during the export process, and used as column headers for the data files. These abbreviated field names are suitable for use with external statistical applications.</p>
		
		<p><b>MMRIA Export Data Dictionary</b> An additional data-dictionary file is created when MMRIA case data are exported. <b>The name of this file is: "data-dictionary.csv"</b>.  Each data-dictionary file is specific to the MMRIA case data that is exported with. This file is used to map the abbreviated field names in the exported data file to the full path field names contained in the MMRIA database. File columns include the exported file name, the abbreviated export field name, the full MMRIA field name, and the MMRIA field prompt.</p>
